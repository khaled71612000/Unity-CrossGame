# Unity CrossGame

**Unity CrossGame** is a dynamic project developed using the Unity game engine. It replicates the classic "Frogger" gameplay where players guide a character across a road filled with obstacles. The project demonstrates advanced game development techniques, focusing on creating a seamless and engaging cross-platform experience.


#### PlayerController.cs
- **Movement Logic:** Manages player movement, including jumping and directional controls.
- **Collision Detection:** Handles interactions with obstacles and power-ups.

#### GameManager.cs
- **Game State Management:** Oversees game states, including start, pause, and game over conditions.
- **Score Tracking:** Updates and displays the player's score based on progress.

#### ObstacleManager.cs
- **Obstacle Generation:** Dynamically generates obstacles on the road.
- **Movement Patterns:** Controls the movement and speed of obstacles to increase difficulty.

### Features
- **Classic Gameplay:** Emulates the "Frogger" style of crossing a busy road while avoiding obstacles.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Ensures smooth performance on different platforms, including PC and mobile.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Increases game difficulty by adjusting obstacle speed and frequency as the player progresses.
